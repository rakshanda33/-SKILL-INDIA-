            What is Mental Health?
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.

      <h3>Person 1</h3>
      <h4>
        After two years of academic success in a bachelor of biomedical science, I started to lose everything. I had a 4.0, I was popular, I was in the army. I won a ton of awards. Professors saluted me in corridors. People just knew who I was.

I started an internship in a neuropharmacology lab. I began to lose my mind, my brain was overly activated, my emotions started to flow like a waterfall. I was overwhelmed with what was happening. I never experienced losing contact with reality before. I began to transform into a mad scientist and creating a whole new experience. I put cat litter on me thinking I could absorb the energy of a parasite that was inside it.

After being 3 hours in the shower testing water, my mother called the cops/ambulance on me. I was escorted in an emergency to the mental hospital. I started when I left a shopping spree that cost me $18,000. I ended up with $78,000 in debts in total.

I started a Quora page just to redistribute the help I have received through psychotherapy. Over the years, I met orientation counselors, special educators, educational therapists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists. Every person I met gave me a part of themselves and shaped who I am today.
